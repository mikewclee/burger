  ## Description
  This project is a burger logger develop with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and an ORM.  We follow the MVC design pattern, use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.  
  
  Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the waiting area page with `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page under Burgers devoured with a 'Delete It!' button.  The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not, with option to deleted it after it's devoured on page.-blue)
